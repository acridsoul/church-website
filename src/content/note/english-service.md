Leader: The Lord be with you. <br>
<span class="text-accent-one font-bold">People: And also with you.</span>

We have come together, 
the people of God,  
drawn by his Spirit. 
longing for his word, to  
praise the holy name
of the lord to share his  
glorious news of grace
 to pray for our needs  
and the pain of the world
to rejoice in his love  
and be sent in his peace.  


Leader:  We are heirs of the Father; <br>
<span class="text-accent-one font-bold">People: Joint heirs with the son,</span>

Leader: Renewed in the Spirit, <br>
<span class="text-accent-one font-bold">People: Together we are one.</span>


If we say we have no sin
 we deceive ourselves  
and the truth is not in us. 
If we confess our sins,  
 in repentance and trust,
 God is faithful and just,  
and will forgive us our sins.
 So let us confess them to 
our Father. 
<br>

<span class="text-accent-one font-bold">People:
 Eternal Father, God of our ancestors  
 before your power all things tremble
 but through  
your son we approach your throne
We have done wrong   
and neglected to do right  
 our sins weigh heavily on our hearts  
Lord have mercy 
 count them against us.  
 Grant us the joy of forgiveness  
 and lighten
 our hearts with the glory of Christ  
 who died 
and rose again for us. Amen</span>  

Leader:
The God and Father of our Lord
 Jesus Christ  
  rejoices at repentance  
 and declares his acceptance 
The dead are alive,   
the lost are found. His goodness and mercy  
 will follow you
 all the days of your life.  
 and you will live in the house
 of the Lord for ever. Amen  

Leader:
Lord of mercy,   
grant us your pardon and peace:  
that cleansed from  
 our sins and with peace  
in our hearts. we may be  
 free to serve you:  
through 
Jesus Christ our Lord.  
 <br>
<span class="text-accent-one font-bold">People:  Amen.</span>

 Leader: Blessed are those
 who live in your house: <br>
<span class="text-accent-one font-bold">People: They will always be singing 
your praise.</span>
 
 Leader: Praise the Lord. <br>
<span class="text-accent-one font-bold">People: The name of the Lord
 be praised</span>
 
Leader: Glory to the Father 
in whom all things began, <br>
<span class="text-accent-one font-bold">People: Glory to the Son who
 became the Son of 
Man, <br> Glory to the Spirit 
who inspires and
renews, <br> The Lord our God 
for ever! Alleluia!</span>


## Jubilate Song

### Verse 1
I will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart:  
I will enter his courts with praise.  
I will say this is the day that the Lord has made:  
I will rejoice for he has made me glad.

### Chorus
He has made me glad, he has made me glad:  
I will rejoice for he has made me glad.  
He has made me glad, 
He has made me glad:  
I will rejoice for he has made me glad.

## Apostles Creed

I believe in God, the Father Almighty,  
Creator of heaven and earth.  
I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,  
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,  
Born of the Virgin Mary,  

Suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
Was crucified, died and was buried;  
He descended to the dead.  

On the third day he rose again;  
He ascended into heaven,  
He is seated at the right hand of the Father,  

And he will come to judge the living and the dead.  
I believe in the Holy Spirit,  

The holy Catholic Church,  
The communion of saints,  
The forgiveness of sins,  
The resurrection of the body,  
And the life everlasting. Amen.

Seek and you shall find,  
Knock and the door shall be opened unto you.  
Allelu, alleluia.</span>

## The Lord's Prayer

Our Father in heaven,  
Hallowed be your name,  
Your kingdom come,

Forgive us our sins,  
As we forgive those who sin against us.  

Lead us not into temptation,  
But deliver us from evil.
