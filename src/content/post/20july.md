## Sermon Notes

### Key Message
How Often Do You Show Compassion To Those Around You?

### Biblical Foundation
- **Romans 5:1-11**: Paul emphasizes that through faith in Christ, we have peace with God and access to His grace. This reconciliation enables us to show compassion to others, as we have experienced God's love and mercy ourselves.
- **Mark 1:40-45**: Jesus demonstrates perfect compassion by healing a leper who was considered unclean and outcast. Despite the social and religious barriers, Jesus reaches out with love and healing, breaking down the walls that separate us from one another.

### Core Sermon Message
- **Compassion breaks down barriers**: Just as Jesus reached across social and religious boundaries to heal the leper, we are called to show compassion without prejudice or discrimination.
- **Our experience of God's grace compels us to show grace**: Having received God's mercy and reconciliation through Christ, we should extend that same compassion to others in our daily lives.
